The airfoil is the heart of an aircraft. 
Selecting the correct airfoil allows us to predict the lift, drag, and pitching moments produced by the wing. 
The lift and drag is obviously important in flying the aircraft, and determining its cruising speed, orientation and power consumption.
The pitching moments should be used in conjunction with the location of the center of mass to determine the sizing of the aircraft tail. 
Too small of an aircraft tail and there is not enough control authority, too large of a tail and the aircraft performance suffers.
