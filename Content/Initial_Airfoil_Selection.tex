\section{Initial Airfoil Selection}
\begin{comment}
\end{comment}
Based on the design requirements, the aircraft needs to have a stall speed that is as low as possible, which drives our wing area to be large.
However, due to the geometric requirements of the craft, there is a limit to how large our wing area can be.
So, if we make sure our wing produces as much lift as possible, we can still have a reasonable wing area with a really low stall speed. 
So, we must prioritize high-lift capable wings.
Therefore, we should choose "fatter" airfoils over their "thinner" counterparts.

\\~\\Here is how we are going to choose our airfoils. 
We are going to have a list of airfoils just by visual inspection of which ones look "fat" for the high maximum lift coefficient and gentle stall characteristics.
Then, we are going to run \texttt{xflr} on it and do wind-tunnel testing to rule all the others out and choose the one that best suits our needs.
The selected airfoils are:
